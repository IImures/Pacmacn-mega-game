# Pacman Styled Game

It's my university project to make a pacman like game.

It is made in Java using Swing. It has some kind of random generated maze, and selecteble size. The game board where 'pacman' and 'ghosts' are moving is made with usage JTable. 

To move pacman and ghosts i made different Threads. Every 5 seconds ghosts are generating PowerUp with 25% chance.

At the end of a game you can choose name then your score will be saved.

Also there is an CTRL+SHIFT+Q hot key to return to the main menu.
